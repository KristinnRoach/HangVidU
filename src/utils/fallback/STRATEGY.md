# Fallback Strategy for HangVidU

This document outlines the fallback strategy for the HangVidU app, focusing on WebRTC, connection handling, and video stream-related features. Each step includes a description and testing requirements.

## Steps

### 1. Extend Vendor Prefix Handling

- **Description**: Update the `callWithFallback` utility to include additional prefixes like `moz` (Firefox) and `o` (Opera).
- **Testing**:
  - Verify that the utility correctly resolves prefixed methods for Fullscreen, PiP, and other APIs.
  - Test on browsers with older implementations (e.g., Safari, Firefox).

### 2. Centralize API Fallbacks

- **Description**: Create a registry of common APIs and their fallbacks (e.g., Fullscreen, PiP, MediaDevices).
- **Testing**:
  - Ensure the registry dynamically resolves the correct method.
  - Test fallback resolution for each API.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

- **Description**: Provide user-friendly messages or alternative functionality when an API is unavailable.
- **Testing**:
  - Simulate API unavailability and verify user feedback.
  - Test alternative functionality (e.g., resizing instead of PiP).

### 4. Future-Proofing

- **Description**: Use feature detection and integrate polyfills for emerging standards.
- **Testing**:
  - Verify feature detection logic.
  - Test polyfills in unsupported environments.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Description**: Ensure all fallbacks include robust error handling to prevent UI issues.
- **Testing**:
  - Simulate API errors and verify error handling.
  - Test user feedback for errors.

### 6. WebRTC and Connection Handling

- **Description**: Implement fallbacks for WebRTC signaling and ICE server configurations.
- **Testing**:
  - Test WebRTC connections in various network conditions.
  - Verify fallback behavior for unsupported browsers.

### 7. Video Stream Features

- **Description**: Add fallbacks for video-related features like Fullscreen and PiP.
- **Testing**:
  - Test Fullscreen and PiP functionality across browsers.
  - Verify fallback behavior for unsupported features.

## Testing Plan

- Write unit tests for the `callWithFallback` utility.
- Create integration tests for API fallback resolution.
- Perform manual testing on a variety of browsers and devices.

## Notes

- Keep the fallback utility modular and reusable.
- Document all changes and ensure developers can easily extend the utility for new APIs.
