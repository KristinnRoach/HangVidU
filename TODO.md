Free file transfer + storage options:

    [] Easiest: GitHub CDN

    [] Better and still free: RTC transfer + IDB storage

UI / UX:

    [] Default to native PiP (bail on Doc pip for now)
    [] Test mute button on floating window

    [] Video effects

# Thoughts for later:

Stremio:

    [] Explore options:
        - Electron ? Download addon (already forked)

IF using server.go:

    [] fix paths in all scripts and server.go files
