# Misc TODO's:

First:

    [] Cleanup
    [] Identify possible issues before refactoring

UI:

    [] Refactor into a FEW SIMPLE UI-components
    [] Consider minimal React integration

Core features:

    [] Firebase auth

    [] Chat messages via firebase

    [] Save contact for easy reconnection wiht the same peer
        - If not signed up could still use IDB ?

    [] Support screenshare


    [] User uploaded video in Watch Mode
        - Needs to sync playback position
        - Free file transfer + storage options:
            [] Easiest: GitHub CDN ?
            [] Better and still free: RTC transfer + IDB storage
            [] Firebase?

    [] Support other video streaming platforms? (Currently just Youtube and direct video urls)

    [] Possibly support conference calls, more than two people on the same call.

Standalone:

    PWA:
        [] Add install button
        [] Decide which offline capabilities are most feasible and useful

Fun / Extra:

    [] Video effects / filters / shaders

# Thoughts for later:

Things to consider / research: - Stremio support ? - Electron ? - Is server.go useful ?
